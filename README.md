# My Dotfiles

I do my development under ~/development, so this repo is expected to live at
~/development/dotfiles.

To install, check the files out to ~/development/dotfiles then run
~/development/dotfiles/install.sh

## VS Code plugins I use (more of a note for me):

* https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go
* https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim
* https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shardulm94.trailing-spaces

To get Vim mode to repeat keystrokes when holding down a key, run:

```none
defaults write com.microsoft.VSCode ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false
```
